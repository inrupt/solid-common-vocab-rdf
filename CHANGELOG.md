# Changelog

This change log is intended to record changes made across all vocabularies and
configuration files contained in this repository.

## Unreleased

- Added CHANGELOG.

## 0.7.4

- Removed `_EXT` suffix from generated Inrupt extension vocabularies (it's not
  necessary given we already suffix with `_INRUPT`).
- Added a number of vocabs to the Common RDF bundle (and hit what seems to be a
  generator limit of 44 concurrent vocabs).
