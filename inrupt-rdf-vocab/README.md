# inrupt-rdf-vocab
Inrupt-specific RDF vocabularies, intended to be shared publicly though.

# LIT Artifact Generator
Also contains a YAML configuration file for use with the
[LIT Artifact Generator](https://github.com/inrupt/lit-artifact-generator-js),
which is extremely useful for generating source-code artifacts (e.g. Java JARs or
NodeJS Modules) containing constants for all the terms contained within those RDF
vocabularies.
