# solid-common-rdf

This repository acts as a mono-repo for all vocabularies defined and controlled 
by Solid.

It also stores Artifact Generator configuration files that allow us generate
programming-language artifacts (e.g. Java JARs, NPM modules, etc.) that provide
convenient constants representing the terms from collections of RDF
vocabularies.
