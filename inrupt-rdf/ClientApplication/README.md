# inrupt-rdf-vocab-client-application

This directory contains the vocabulary list file for the Inrupt client application vocabularies,
and includes any local RDF vocabularies, and extensions (typically as Turtle files).

The vocabulary list file configures the generation and publication of programming-language
artifacts (i.e. Java JARs, JavaScript packages, etc.) that bundle together classes for each of
the vocabularies referenced, whereby each class will contain constants for each of the terms
(e.g. the RDF Classes, Properies and constants) described within an individual vocabulary.
