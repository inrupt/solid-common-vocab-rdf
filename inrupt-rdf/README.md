# inrupt-rdf-vocab

Inrupt-specific RDF vocabularies, such as product-specific vocabs, or our
glossaries, or vocabularies tailored to our UI components or client
applications, etc.

We bundle related sets of these vocabularies into generated programming-language
artifacts that provide convenient classes containing constants for all the terms
in these vocabularies, and publish them to public repositories (e.g., to
`npmjs.org` for JavaScript, or Cloudsmith for Java):
