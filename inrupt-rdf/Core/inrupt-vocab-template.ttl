#
# Prefix for terms from Inrupt's Artifact Generator vocabulary - use is purely
# optional, but by explicitly marking a vocabulary as being
# 'Inrupt-Artifact-Generator-compliant' (i.e., by typing it as being of
# RDF:type 'inrupt_gen:Ontology'), tools (like the Artifact Generator itself)
# can enforce certain Best Practices (like those defined by Inrupt, which
# basically follow the principles of FAIR, but are also extended to include
# RDF-specific practices (like all terms telling us what vocabulary they are
# defined by, or each term providing short and long descriptions, in at least
# English, etc.).
#
prefix inrupt_gen:    <https://inrupt.com/vocab/tool/artifact_generator/>

#
# This prefix and the associated IRI are intended to be renamed to suit your
# specific vocabulary (i.e., copy this template, and then search-and-replace
# all occurrences of both the prefix and it's IRI value)...
#
prefix your_prefix: <https://namespace.your-domain.com/vocab/your_prefix>

#
# Describe our vocabulary - i.e., an English description, its version, who
# created it, its suggested prefix, its license, etc.
#
# We can (if we like) explicitly type this vocab as being an Inrupt Artifact
# Generator-compliant vocab (or 'Ontology') too, meaning we expect the
# Artifact Generator to be able to enforce its set of RDF guidelines to help
# ensure this vocab remains high-quality.
