# vocab-inrupt-core

Inrupt core vocabularies - these are vocabularies common across all of Inrupt,
client-side and server-side. 

A vocabulary list file configures the generation, packaging, and publication
of programming-language artifacts (e.g., Java JARs, JavaScript packages, etc.)
that bundle together classes for each of the RDF vocabularies listed, whereby
each class will contain constants for each of the terms (e.g., the RDF
Classes, Properties and constants) described within an individual vocabulary.
