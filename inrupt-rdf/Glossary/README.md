# vocab-inrupt-glossary

Inrupt glossary vocabularies. 

A vocabulary list file configures the generation, packaging, and publication
of programming-language artifacts (e.g., Java JARs, JavaScript packages, etc.)
that bundle together classes for each of the RDF vocabularies listed, whereby
each class will contain constants for each of the terms (e.g., the RDF
Classes, Properies and constants) described within an individual vocabulary.
