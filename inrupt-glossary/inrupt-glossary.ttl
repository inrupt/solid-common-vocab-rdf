ess-architecture:ESS a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "ESS" ;
    rdfs:comment "The Enterprise Solid Server (ESS) is solid specification compliant software made up of various microservices, infrastructure, and storage components. It is developed, maintained, and licensed by inrupt. inc" .

ess-architecture:identity_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "identity_service" ;
    rdfs:comment "The identity service is an Identity Provider that stores user credentials (e.g. username and password), and allows those users to login to any OIDC-compatible service using those credentials" .

ess-architecture:ldp_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "ldp_service" ;
    rdfs:comment "The LDP Service is an implementation of the W3C Linked Data Platform, and provides support for creating, updating, deleting and navigating resources (which can be represented as RDF data, or binary data)." .

ess-architecture:websocket_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "websocket_service" ;
    rdfs:comment "The websocket service exposes a WebSocket endpoint that implements the Solid Websocket specification: https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-websockets.md" .

ess-architecture:notification_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "notification_service" ;
    rdfs:comment "The notification service acts as a centralized notification hub for all internal ESS activity, and can also provide high-level user notifications, for example email notifications, or WebSub notifications." .

ess-architecture:logging_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "logging_service" ;
    rdfs:comment "This logging service acts as a centralized logging repository, where all ESS components report event activity (including DEBUG log messages, error events, user activity, security events, etc.)" .

ess-architecture:auditing_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "auditing_service" ;
    rdfs:comment  "The auditing service can be used to immutably record any system activity, just one example of which might be recording event activity to a blockchain." .

ess-architecture:metric_service a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "metric_service" ;
    rdfs:comment  "This metric service acts as a repository for all system metrics. These metrics can range from low-level system metrics (like CPU, memory or disk utilization, all the way up to application metrics (like service response times, or errors per hour). The metrics are collected across all ESS components, and from all replicas of those components." .
