# solid-rdf-vocab

This repository contains a configuration file for the Inrupt Artifact Generator that creates
source-code artifacts (e.g. Java JAR, npm Module, etc.) for the terms (e.g. the Classes
and Properties) defined in existing Solid-specific RDF vocabularies (for example the [Solid
vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms) and the [WebACL vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl)).

## Experimental Solid Vocabularies

This repository also contains collections of RDF vocabularies that Inrupt thinks may
become useful as general Solid RDF vocabularies in the future (and corresponding
Artifact Generator configuration files to easily support the generation of source-code
artifacts providing constants for all the terms defined in those vocabularies).

**_Note_:** The experimental RDF vocabularies contained here are for internal Inrupt
experimental purposes only, and are not yet intended to be shared or used publicly.
