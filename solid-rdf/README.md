# vocab-solid

This repository contains a configuration file for the Inrupt Artifact
Generator that creates source-code artifacts (e.g., Java JAR, npm Module,
etc.) for the terms (e.g., the Classes and Properties) defined in existing
Solid-specific RDF vocabularies (for example the
[Solid vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms) and the
[WebACL vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl)).

## Experimental Solid Vocabularies

This repository also contains RDF vocabularies that Inrupt thinks may become
useful as general Solid RDF vocabularies in the future (and corresponding
Artifact Generator configuration files to easily support the generation of
source-code artifacts providing constants for all the terms defined in these
vocabularies).

**_Note_:** The experimental RDF vocabularies contained here are for internal
Inrupt purposes only, and are not yet intended to be shared or used publicly.
